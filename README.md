A Minecraft 1.21.1 mod which features new Blaze armor and tools waiting to be crafted by you!

If you happen to find any bugs or inconsistencies in the Typhoon mod or its sister Inferno, be sure to report them here!

I accept pull requests; however, the majority of development is done internally by myself.
